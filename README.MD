# CSE5280 Assignment 1
This is a rotating hyper cube written in Matlab. I have not worked in matlab before this, so my code is pretty ugly looking. I will be reading up on matlab and looking at examples of cleaner code to clean this up.

## Rotating Hyper Cube
The goal of this assignment is to write a program that creates a rotating hyper cube through matrix multiplication. My final version does not look like the example, but it does rotate with an inner cube expanding/contracting. I had issues pivoting the initial cube up on its corner.
